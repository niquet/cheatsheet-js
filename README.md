## Functions
* "Self contained" modules of code accomplishing a specific task
* Functions "encapsulate" a tak combining many instructions into a (mostly) single line of code
* Usually "take in" data, then process it and finally "return" a result
* Once a function is defined, it can be used repeatedly inside the program
* Can be used outside the program as well (later more on modules and exports of functions)
* High order functions allow functions to call other functions within their "encapsulation"
